# 400 - Conclusion

Based on "Create macOS or Linux virtual machines" at https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10002/ from 22:17 to the end

We've seen that creating virtual machines has never been simpler.

With Virtualization framework, you can get virtual machines running with just a few lines of code.

We have also seen that virtual machines are ridiculously fast on macOS.

To learn more about Virtualization, I invite you to check out the code samples and documentation.

And on behalf of the team, we cannot wait to see what you will do next with this technology.
