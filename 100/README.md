# 100 - Introduction

Based on "Create macOS or Linux virtual machines" at https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10002/

Learn how you can use the Virtualization framework to quickly create virtual machines on your Mac. We'll show you how to create a virtual Mac and quickly test changes to your app in an isolated environment. We'll also explore how you can install and run full Linux distributions on Apple silicon, and share how you can take advantage of Rosetta 2 to run x86-64 Linux binaries.

Benjamin Poulain: Hi everyone, and welcome to our session about virtualization.
This is what we are going to do together today.
We'll see how you can run macOS and Linux inside virtual machines, on Apple silicon.
By the end of this session, you will be able to do the same on your own Mac.
This may seem a little ambitious, but stick with us, and we'll do it together.
 
## Here is our agenda for today.
 
We will start with an overview of virtualization technologies, and we'll see how to use Virtualization framework to build virtual machines.
Then we'll do a deep dive into macOS.
